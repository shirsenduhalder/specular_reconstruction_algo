\dagg Tin \etal \cite{tin20163d} adopt a two-layer liquid crystal display (LCD) setup to encode the illumination directions and devise an efficient ray coding scheme by only considering the useful rays. To recover the mirror-type surface, they derive a normal integration scheme under the perspective camera model. They further develop a surface reconstruction algorithm under perspective projection to generate complete profile of a mirror-type object.

\textit{Ye \etal \cite{ye2012angular} is based on reconstruction in dynamic fluids.}
