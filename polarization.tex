\dagg Lu \etal \cite{lu2019mirror} use a dense illumination field with angularly varying polarization states, called polarization field. They use a commercial LCD and
mathematically model the liquid crystals as polarization rotators using Jones calculus and show that the rotated polarization states of outgoing rays encode angular information. A reflection image formation model based on the Fresnel's equations is derived and the incident ray positions and directions are estimated using the polarization field. 

Jospin \etal \cite{jospin2018embedded} incorporate polarization filters in camera designs to separate the specular and diffuse components.

\dagg Ba \etal \cite{ba2019physics} use deep learning techniques to solve the Shape from Polarization problem by blending approximate physics into neural networks.
